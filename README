SUMMARY
-------

This module implements a batch framework, as well as a basic ZIP/directory
ingester.

The ingest is a two-step process:
* Preprocessing: The data is scanned, and a number of entries created in the
  Drupal database.  There is minimal processing done at this point, so it can
  complete outside of a batch process.
* Ingest: The data is actually processed and ingested. This happens inside of
  a Drupal batch.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

A full Islandora installation.

INSTALLATION
------------

Install in the same way as any other Drupal module.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

USAGE
-------------

There base ZIP/directory preprocessor can be called as a drush script, so
something like (see "drush help islandora_batch_scan_preprocess" for
additional parameters):
"drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_batch_scan_preprocess --type=zip --target=/path/to/archive.zip"
should serve to populate the queue (stored in the Drupal database) with base entries.

The queue of preprocessed items can then be processed something like:
"drush -v --user=admin --uri=http://localhost islandora_batch_ingest"

CUSTOMIZATION
-------------

Custom ingests can be written by extending any of the existing preprocessors
and batch object implementations.
